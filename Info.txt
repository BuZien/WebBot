WebBot version 1.0
Not stable and fucking shit but worth to develop.
Used to access blocked websites and etc using free proxies if you don't have money.
Made by Ahmed Ism3lawy using Python 3, Selenium and Chrome Undetected driver.

You can use the exe file or you can improve the script using Visual Studio Code and Python
for visual sc or any other editor you use these commands to install all drivers you need

pip install undetected-chromedriver
pip install selenium

if you are in virtual server or you have any problems to setup drivers
so you can use --> py -m
before pip command.

Thanks <3
